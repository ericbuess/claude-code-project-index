## Project Analysis

Run comprehensive semantic analysis to understand code patterns, architecture, and complexity metrics.

### What this does:

- Analyzes function patterns and complexity
- Identifies architectural patterns
- Creates semantic embeddings for similarity detection
- Provides vocabulary analysis of your codebase

### Current project status:

!`pwd && ls -la scripts/semantic_analyzer.py`

### Running semantic analysis:

!`python3 scripts/semantic_analyzer.py`

This will enhance your PROJECT_INDEX.json with semantic intelligence for better code understanding.
